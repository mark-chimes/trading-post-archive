Example Conversations: 

Player: Hello, and welcome to my humble store! 
[Greeting: Welcome, Enthusiastic, Mention store: My Humble Store]
Client: Hi there, I'm just looking for something to help me defend myself against wild animals. 
[Desires...]
Player: Ah, yes, I believe I have exactly what you are looking for! Here, look at this steel broadsword. 
[Offer Item, Confident, Item#ID (Steel Broadsword)]
Client: *Examines broadsword*
Player: It is of the finest quality cold-wrought steel, forged by Dwarves from the town of Delheim!
[Promote Item, Exaggerate: Cold-wrought steel / forged by Dwarves -> Delheim]
Client: Hmm... sounds pricey. How much are you asking? 
Player: For you, my good lady, a fair price! Only 120 gold!
[Name customer: anonymous, respectful, Request 120 gp]
Client: 120 gold! I want to defend myself against wild animals, not slay a dragon! Don't you have anything more in my price range? 
Player: Ah, but you cannot pass up on such a good item! It suits your armour so well! For you, I will lower my price to just 90 gold!
[Insist, Promote: Suits customer -> Armour, Request 90 gp]
Client: Well, now, I suppose I can't really say no to that!
Player: And just because you are such a wonderful customer, I shall throw in a free whetstone to keep your blade sharp!

Client: How wonderful! *Accepts trade*
Player: Is there anything else I can help you with? 
[Ask Question: Anything Else, Polite]

Player: Certainly. That will be 99 copper per packet.
[Acknowledge: Enthusiastic, Request 99 copper / item]
Client: Then I shall take three packets!
Player: Here you are! Three packets of trail mix for 2 silvers and 97 copper
[Acknowledge: Enthusiastic, Accept Offer at Given Price]
